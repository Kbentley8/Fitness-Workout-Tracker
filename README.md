# Fitness-Workout-Tracker


![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

## Description

This application features a simple workout tracker. This app allows users to input data into dropdown menu that provides them with what kind of workout they did (resistance or cardio), how long their workout was, the amount of miles traveled, and features reps/sets for resistance work. The dashboard then collects the user's stats and displays them on graphs for quick reference and documents the previous few workouts.
